Critical Issues (5 total):

1. Hero Section Typography & Alignment
- Excessive spacing between headline and subtitle.
- Headline should be left-aligned, not centered.

2. CTA Button Order
- Buttons were in the wrong order (primary on left, secondary on right).
- Should be: Secondary (Watch Demo) on the left, Primary (Evaluate) on the right.
- Designer flagged this as a major issue.

3. Hero Card Layout & Image Distortion
- Current 3-column layout is causing images to stretch and become elongated.
- Images do not fit cards properly.
- Solution: Use a 2-column asymmetric grid—one tall vertical card on the left, two stacked horizontal cards on the right.

4. Image Cropping Strategy
- Current images include too much unnecessary content.
- Images should be cropped to focus on key sections (graph, scorecard, list).

5. Attribution Spacing
- Footer attribution text ("Built with 8090.ai Software Factory by Rohit Kelapure") does not have enough space below.
- Needs increased spacing at the bottom of the page for better breathing room.
