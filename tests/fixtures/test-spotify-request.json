  "prd_text": "# Spotify Rewards System PRD\n\n## Understanding the Target Audience\n\nUser segment in focus and the size of the segment: MAU of Spotify India: 60 Mn\n\nUsers aged 18–24 are dissatisfied with the free tier of Spotify due to poor song recommendations and excessive ads, leading to low conversion to premium and high churn rates.\n\n## Survey Results\n\nWe conducted a survey of 500 free-tier users aged 18-24:\n- 86% complained about a lot of ads\n- 28% complained about poor music recommendation\n- Only 6% said premium is expensive\n\n18-24 age group listens 0-120 minutes per day on the platform.\n\n## Problem Definition\n\nThe target demographic experiences:\n1. Excessive ad interruptions during listening sessions\n2. Poor music discovery and recommendations\n3. Low engagement with premium features\n\nThis results in:\n- Low conversion to premium (only 6% cite price as barrier)\n- High churn in the 18-24 demographic\n- Reduced time spent listening\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### 1. Reward System\n\nDaily Reward: Users who listen for 90 minutes in a day unlock access to one premium playlist until midnight.\n\nWeekly Reward: Users who maintain a 7-day listening streak receive 1-day Premium access.\n\n### 2. Mood AI Chat Bot\n\nThis solution involves the implementation of an AI chatbot that interacts with users.\n\nThe chatbot will ask users about their mood and the types of songs or podcasts they are interested in. Based on the user's responses, it provides personalized music and podcast recommendations.\n\n### 3. Hyper Localised Playlist\n\nCreate region-specific playlists based on user location and local music trends.\n\nThis feature uses location data to curate playlists.\n\n## Goals and Metrics\n\nAs of now we only focus on increasing the time spent listening of existing users and not focus on onboarding new users.\n\nThis incentive aims to increase the user's listening time, enhance content discovery, and encourage deeper exploration of Spotify's features.\n\n## Key Metrics\n\n- Time Spent Listening: Indicates overall user engagement with the app\n- Average Session Duration: Measures how long users stay engaged\n- Playlist Access Rate: Tracks usage of premium playlist rewards\n- Streak Completion Rate: Monitors user retention through streaks\n\n## Integration\n\nProvide temporary premium playlist access via tokens.\n\nEnable 1-day premium subscription for streak completion.\n\n## Schema Changes\n\nAdd fields in user_profile:\n- daily_listening_time\n- current_streak\n- playlist_access_table\n\n## Tracking Events\n\n- Session start/end\n- Daily goal achievement\n- Streak milestones\n- Premium playlist access\n- Trial activations\n\n## System Design\n\n[Diagram showing User → Tracking Service → Reward Engine → Notification Service]\n\nThe system will track user listening behavior, calculate eligibility, grant rewards, and send notifications.\n\n## Marketing Plan\n\n1. In-App Notifications\n2. Email Campaigns\n3. Social Media Promotion\n4. Influencer Partnerships\n5. Gamification Elements\n6. Onboarding Tutorials\n7. Blog Posts\n8. Advertiser Collaborations\n9. Referral Bonuses\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n1. Listening Time Not Captured Properly\n2. Streak Reset Error\n3. Reward Not Granted\n4. Playlist Access Issues\n5. User Exceeds Time Goal Without Reward Recognition\n6. Duplicate Reward Issue\n7. Premium Trial Activation Errors\n8. Unclear Progress Tracking\n9. System Downtime"
