Speaker 1   00:00
Yeah,

Speaker 2   00:03
Interesting. Starting at the top, the um, there's too much spacing between the first two lines. Yes, also, I think this should be left alone. It should also be left aligned to here. Yeah,

Speaker 1   00:14
The

Speaker 2   00:14
Primary CTA should be on the right, and the secondary should be on the left for this kind of a horizontal.

Speaker 1   00:19
That's a big Miss, and

Speaker 2   00:22
This is nice. I like that you like that,

Speaker 1   00:24
Bam.

Speaker 2   00:26
Okay, I don't really know what it is, but it's nice.

Speaker 1   00:27
Yeah, um, the image

Speaker 2   00:29
Is just.

Speaker 1   00:31
Do you fix this, like the, what do you have to do because I have the appropriate images? Yeah, is it

Speaker 2   00:36
Just

Speaker 1   00:36
Like a UI thing?

Speaker 2   00:38
Think. Are the images like different heights?

Speaker 1   00:41
These are they are really like elongated images, right? Um, so they are longish images, so you can either crop them or it's, like, yeah, I

Speaker 2   00:52
Think I might like craft them to be the same height, um, weaknesses to the categories with the.

Not

Speaker 1   01:03
Like responsive how you doing figma, right? Yeah,

Speaker 2   01:05
I think like the card might just be a different size in the image, and so it's stretching it.

Speaker 1   01:12
Garden in general. Does it make sense to have all of it a lot of it, or just like chop it in the middle and just do squares like I could just chop it in this line.

Speaker 2   01:21
Yeah, I think that might be good. I feel like with this image, you don't really need so much. Yeah, got it. This image is the main thing, the graph.

Speaker 1   01:29
Yes, correct. Okay. And here it's the score, so you could

Speaker 3   01:33
Almost do this vertical and two horizontal like that. You know, what I mean,

Speaker 1   01:36
Would that be

Speaker 2   01:37
Nice? That would be

Speaker 1   01:37
Interesting, right? I like that, yeah.

Speaker 2   01:38
That would be really nice. Yeah, yeah.

I think a little bit more space below this. And

Speaker 1   01:52
This makes sense. Yeah, that's the just the the eval. And then, like, build, yeah, that's great. It took me, like all of them, all right, perfect. That's nice. That's a, that's. That's.
