# LinkedIn Post: Code Understanding Uplift (Teaser)

---

**Your team ships AI-generated code they don't understand.**

New engineers: 3-9 months to productivity.
Senior engineers: 5+ hours weekly helping others catch up.
Legacy modernization: 18 months (9 months just understanding the old code).

The problem isn't generation speed. It's comprehension.

I researched 10 code understanding techniques and found this:

**Tier 1** (1-2 weeks, <$5K): Semantic Search + LLM explanations + Behavioral Analysis
**Tier 2** (2-8 weeks, $10K-50K): RAG pipelines + Knowledge Graphs
**Tier 3** (8-16 weeks, $50K-200K): Codemaps (Cognition.ai)

Deploy Tier 1 before your next modernization project.

**Result**: 18 months → 12 months. 50% faster.

Compress 9 months of reverse-engineering into 3 months with AI.

As Cognition AI says: **AI should turn brains ON, not OFF**.
